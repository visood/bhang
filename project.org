#+TITLE: Graphical introduction to C++

Bjarne Stroustrup (BS) holds that
#+begin_src:
Graphics are a very rich source of concrete and practical examples of design
decisions and design techniques. ...designing classes, designing functions,
separating software into layers (of abstraction), and constructing libraries...
#+end_src


While we will follow BS's book, we will also follow FLTK examples from around
the internet.
